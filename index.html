  Loved it‚ù§ The signature of love.  One of the seven wonders. A great reminder of true love and devotion. A beauty that needs to be seen. Great history. A decent guide can treat you right.

The following are my personal opinions and review of 2019 remake of The Lion King. I have kept it as spoiler-free as possible.

I haven‚Äôt had the fortune of watching the 1994 original The Lion King or the 2012 3D re-release in theaters, but I still remember watching the it on Television after it was digitally re-mastered. From then on, it has been on my top favourite list. I have watched the movie again and again and still cherish the experience.

I've genuinely never come out of a movie feeling so bitter, disappointed and angry.
Be prepared, for two hours of disappointment!
Be prepared for a sensational fail!

(Spoilers and basically just anger ahead)

Seriously. Every dramatic moment was rushed through. No dramatic pauses, no moments or time of realisation that simba is alive. They removed important scenes (rafiki and his stick, simba realizing how big his dads footprint was and how much he needed to grow, simba actually defending himself properly against scar in the end etc.) and dialogue (Scar, BROTHER, help me. Who are you? How do you know me? Murderer, etc. )only to replace the scenes with showing off how well they render water, or grass, or animals that add nothing to the story. The dialogue was 4th wall breaking and extra fart/poop jokes.

Simba seeing his dad in the clouds? Too hard to do, just look at the clouds for a bit. Simbas big roar at the end? Mistimed and went early, ruining the suspence. Plus loss of him dramatically walking up pride rock. Pumba running from nala and it being funny? Gone. The magic of rafiki being surprised simba is alive? Gone. Well all of rafiki, gone. Funny zazu quotes? Gone. Ive got a lovely bunch of coconuts? Gone. MR.Pig joke replaced with a "be proud to be fat" joke. 

All the characters were stripped of their personalities or given more annoying ones. Timone is straight up a horrible per...meerkat. Pumba/nala aren't characters, theyre literally just beyonce and seth rogan. Rafiki was pointless, he taught simba nothing and really had no need to be in the film. He was bland. Zazu was not funny, he lost his sarcasm and became much too serious.  Scar lost anything that made him seem clever or sinister. He was a weak mess that even the hyenas were not afraid of.
 The hyenas were either annoying or serious. Couldnt possibly have a mentally challenged hyena could we? Could be offensive. Simba was a mopey spoilt kid who learnt nothing. He had no personality apart from stupidity, came across like malfoy. No power, just a mummys boy. "Get away from my mother!" Came off as just sort of pathetic.

Only thing it has is amazing cgi.

This is much more of a rant than a review but sadly i cant wipe my memory. Go watch the original. This one isn't worth the time.

As a big fan of this film since childhood, I know that the 1994 version of this visually fantastic movie will never be beaten. Thus, the remake of this film did not reach that goal. However, it did bring some new perspectives for millions of eyes around the world. Jon Favreau, director of many films, including 2016's the Jungle Book, did an excellent job with this CGI remake of the Lion King.
I am proud to be one of several theater witnesses on opening day to watch this wonderfully made film. Although -- admittedly -- the animals don't have a flexible amount of facial expressions, the story, the music, the scenery, to me, is what was most important. I think Jon and the whole cast and crew did a wonderful job recreating a masterpiece, trying not to top it, but trying to expand it a little for the new generation of high film making technology. I did cry a few times, I laughed several times, but my mouth was in awe nearly the entire way through. One of the things that excited me for this movie was the major fact that the legendary James Earl Jones, the original Mufasa himself, decided to come back to play everyone's favorite king of the Pridelands. At age 88, he sounds as though he hardly aged! What a blessing.
Everyone else did a splendid job with their parts, creating emotions through their body language if not through their faces. The crew did beautifully with the realistic visual designs for both the scenes and the characters. The music had me moving so much as it was a near replica of the original soundtrack from 1994 -- only, it was more epic!
Thank you again, Jon, for collaborating with Disney and several other talented people, to help make this movie beautiful, moving, and intense, once again. I look forward to buying this on DVD once it releases!
